    "The goal of sentiment analysis, often referred to as opinion mining, is to recognize and classify subjective information conveyed in text. It is an essential part of natural language processing, or NLP. It is highly significant in a number of fields, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Business Intelligence: By examining consumer comments, reviews, and social media posts, sentiment analysis assists businesses in determining market trends, customer satisfaction, and brand perception.\n",
    "Social media monitoring allows you to keep an eye on what the general public thinks, spot new trends, and track changes in sentiment in real time on sites like Facebook, Twitter, and so on.\n",
    "Customer service: By automating the study of customer assistance interactions, sentiment analysis enables businesses to effectively prioritize and resolve problems.\n",
    "Market research: By helping to understand customer behavior, preferences, and attitudes toward goods and services, it may be used to inform product development and marketing tactics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope: The goal of this research is to create and assess sentiment analysis models that are especially suited for texts written in Azerbaijani Turkish. Tokenization and word embeddings are two examples of NLP techniques that will be explored in order to determine how they affect model performance. The following are the project's main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection: Obtaining a dataset of texts written in Azerbaijani Turkish that includes popularity and sentiment evaluations. It is granted to us so we'll skip this.\n",
    "Preprocessing: Tokenization, normalization, noise reduction, and other cleaning and preparation of the text data for analysis.\n",
    "Model Development: Putting sentiment analysis models into practice using various natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as deep learning architectures and conventional machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "Evaluation: Using suitable evaluation measures, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to gauge how well the generated models function.\n",
    "Comparison: Evaluating how well various word embeddings and tokenization techniques improve sentiment analysis accuracy.\n",
    "Documentation: For future reference and repeatability, recording the procedures, conclusions, and insights discovered during the project.\n",
